# Smartsheet-Integration-Node

- A Automation project done with the motivation to reduce manual human intervention.  Prior to the development of this automation engine, tasks were done in a traditional fashion: The process included getting data from the Smartsheet Source in a bulk (Huge Dataset in often cases not required ones) which would take 3-5 mins (Depeniding on the bandwith of the internet). 
- Once the data would finally load in the Local present Excel Sheet, team would run it through a gigantic flow of Tableau Flow to cleanse the dat. However, the painful part was the data was still not obtained in the required format as per our stakeholders. 
- The process would involve more cleasning and manual intervention by a human to produce the exact desired format as our Stakeholders.
