# Smartsheet-Integration-Node

- A Automation project done with the motivation to reduce manual human intervention.  Prior to the development of this automation engine, tasks were done in a traditional fashion: The process included getting data from the Smartsheet Source in a bulk (Huge Dataset in often cases not required ones) which would take 3-5 mins (Depeniding on the bandwith of the internet). 
- Once the data would finally load in the Local present Excel Sheet, team would run it through a gigantic flow of Tableau Flow to cleanse the dat. However, the painful part was the data was still not obtained in the required format as per our stakeholders. 
- The process would involve more cleasning and manual intervention by a human to produce the exact desired format as our Stakeholders. To add the process was error prone.

So, here the story beings wouldn't it be ideal if the data tht is alredy located somewhere in the internet can be extracted on a cloud sever, then send the final required set of data as per the stakeholders format on the fly?
